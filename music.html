<p>Red Velvet's song "Bad Boy" has caught the attention of many kpop listeners. The relaxed, almost languorous stucture of the song brought the conceptual union of the fun 'red' and with the sensual 'velvet'. The other two new songs on the repackage also ring with Red Velvet-ness. "All Right" would have felt quite at home on any of the group's "red"-concept 2015 or 2016 albums with its sugar-rush, slightly retro brand of quirky pop-though, now that I think about it, it also would have been a standout on those albums, which just goes to show how Red Velvet really does improve with every comeback the way their fans say they do. The slower, jazz-touched "Time to Love" recalls the "velvet" side of Red Velvet's identity, bringing to mind songs like "About Love" and "Hear the Sea."
<br>
<br>Notably, "The Perfect Red Velvet" is the first repackage album for a girl group under SM since Girls' Generation's "Mr.Taxi" in 2011. This is indicative of SM's new Red Velvet agenda, which became apparent midway through last year when they suddenly upped the girls' activity by a factor of ten, giving them a webshow and a Twitter account as well as a blitz of new music to perform. If SM continues to promote the group as they're doing now, Red Velvet might be the next top girl group-that is, if the acceleration of supergroup TWICE continues to slow and if Red Velvet themselves don't burn out before the end of the year. This latter certainly isn't the least of my concerns, especially given the difficulties SM artists have faced within the past months, not to mention the stacked schedule Red Velvet have had between end-of-the-year award shows and preparations for this comeback. But their performance is as professional and charismatic as ever, so ideally the coming year will bring them as much success as their recent comebacks have had.<br>
